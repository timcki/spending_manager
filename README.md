# Spending Manager
Spending manager created as an assignment for a university project.

## Running
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
and then open `localhost:3000` in your browser

## Developing
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
files for flask and react are attached as volumes on running containers which means live reload should work properly.
